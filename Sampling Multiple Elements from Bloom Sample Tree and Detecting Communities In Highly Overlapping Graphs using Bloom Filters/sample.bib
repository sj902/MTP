abstract="In the field of social community detection, it is commonly accepted to utilize graphs with reference community structure for accuracy evaluation. The method for generating large random social graphs with realistic community structure is introduced in the paper. The resulting graphs have several of recently discovered properties of social community structure which run counter to conventional wisdom: dense community overlaps, superlinear growth of number of edges inside a community with its size, and power law distribution of user-community memberships. Further, the method is by-design distributable and showed near-linear scalability in Amazon EC2 cloud using Apache Spark implementation.",

abstract="Exploring local community structure is an appealing problem that has drawn much recent attention in the area of social network analysis. As the complete information of network is often difficult to obtain, such as networks of web pages, research papers and Facebook users, people can only detect community structure from a certain source vertex with limited knowledge of the entire graph. The existing approaches do well in measuring the community quality, but they are largely dependent on source vertex and putting too strict policy in agglomerating new vertices. Moreover, they have predefined parameters which are difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a method to find local community structure by analyzing link similarity between the community and the vertex. Inspired by the fact that elements in the same community are more likely to share common links, we explore community structure heuristically by giving priority to vertices which have a high link similarity with the community. A three-phase process is also used for the sake of improving quality of community structure. Experimental results prove that our method performs effectively not only in computer-generated graphs but also in real-world graphs.",
